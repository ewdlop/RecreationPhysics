# A Mental Model

## Using the bayesian probability.

```python
from scipy.stats import beta

# Define the Bayesian prior and likelihood
# Assume a prior belief that 10% of civilizations are able to overcome greed and waste efficiently

# Prior: 90% chance that a civilization misuses antimatter and 10% chance they overcome the delays
prior_success = 0.1  # Prior for civilizations overcoming delays (efficiency)

# Likelihood: Based on the number of civilizations surviving long enough to progress
# Let's assume that the chance of a civilization surviving to Type II without wasting antimatter is 0.05
likelihood_success = 0.05  # Probability of a civilization reaching Type II after overcoming delays

# Bayesian update: Posterior probability of overcoming delays given prior belief and likelihood
posterior_alpha = prior_success * (1 - likelihood_success)
posterior_beta = (1 - prior_success) * likelihood_success

# Use Beta distribution to update belief
posterior_distribution = beta(posterior_alpha, posterior_beta)

# Plot the Bayesian posterior distribution
x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
y = posterior_distribution.pdf(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, y, label="Posterior Probability", color="purple")
plt.fill_between(x, 0, y, alpha=0.3, color="purple")
plt.xlabel("Probability of Overcoming Greed")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.title("Bayesian Update for Probability of Reaching Higher Civilization")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Posterior mean (expected probability)
posterior_mean = posterior_distribution.mean()

### **ðŸš€ Bayesian Probability of Overcoming Greed and Reaching Higher Civilizations ðŸš€**

#### **1. Key Findings**
- The **posterior probability** of a civilization overcoming greed and reaching a **Type II civilization** (harnessing a starâ€™s energy) is approximately **67.9%**.

#### **2. Interpretation**
- Given the initial **prior** belief that 10% of civilizations would overcome delays, and the **likelihood** that 5% of civilizations would survive and advance without antimatter waste, there is now a **~68% chance** that civilizations will eventually overcome their own mistakes and reach higher stages of development.
  
- This suggests that **despite the setbacks**, a majority of civilizations could still **make it** to higher levels of technological sophistication and space-faring capability.
